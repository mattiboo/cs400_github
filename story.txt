It was a dark and stormy night in the middle of the forest. A little girl was walking 
down the path to deliver cookies to her grandmother's house.  All of a sudden, a big 
bad wolf jumped out of nowhere and asked the little girl to borrow some of her cookies.
The girl told the wolf that the cookies were for her grandmother and to go bake his
own.  The wolf, having no oven, did not like that and stormed off to generate a new
plan to steal the girl's cookies.

The wolf went back to his cave, took a stick in his mouth and began drawing out his plans on the ground.
He was considering disguising himself as the girl's grandmother and asking her for the cookies again but
the girl would see it coming from a mile away, he was a very bad actor after all. A lightbulb suddenly went
off in his head. Maybe he didn't need to steal the cookies. He just needed an oven to cook his own and he 
knew exactly where to find one: the little girl's house! He used to see the girl often and knew exactly where
she lived and since the girl wan't at home right now. It was a great opportunity to break in.
