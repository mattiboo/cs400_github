It was a dark and stormy night in the middle of the forest. A little girl was walking 
down the path to deliver cookies to her grandmother's house.  All of a sudden, a big 
bad wolf jumped out of nowhere and asked the little girl to borrow some of her cookies.
The girl told the wolf that the cookies were for her grandmother and to go bake his
own.  The wolf, having no oven, did not like that and stormed off to generate a new
plan to steal the girl's cookies.

The wolf went back to his cave, took a stick in his mouth and began drawing out his plans on the ground.
He was considering disguising himself as the girl's grandmother and asking her for the cookies again but
the girl would see it coming from a mile away, he was a very bad actor after all. A lightbulb suddenly went
off in his head. Maybe he didn't need to steal the cookies. He just needed an oven to cook his own and he 
knew exactly where to find one: the little girl's house! He used to see the girl often and knew exactly where
she lived and since the girl wan't at home right now. It was a great opportunity to break in.

The wolf snuck over to the girl's house where nobody appeared to be home. He peeked through
one of the windows to double check the girl was nowhere to be seen. Then, the wolf stealthily 
opened the door and snuck in. Once inside he quickly found the kitchen and set to work trying
to make cookies. However, he had overlooked one key thing: he didn't know how to bake cookies!
The wolf realized his oversight and felt sad that he would never be able to make cookies. Just
then the girl walked through the front door and saw the wolf on the floor of the kitchen. She
asked what was the matter, which the wolf startled and sadly replied he didn't know how to bake 
cookies. The girl laughed and said she could teach the wolf the best cookie recipe ever. The wolf
smiled and together they baked cookies for many hours, filling the woods with the delicious aroma
of chocolate chips and cookie dough.
