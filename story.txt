It was a dark and stormy night in the middle of the forest. A little girl was walking 
down the path to deliver cookies to her grandmother's house.  All of a sudden, a big 
bad wolf jumped out of nowhere and asked the little girl to borrow some of her cookies.
The girl told the wolf that the cookies were for her grandmother and to go bake his
own.  The wolf, having no oven, did not like that and stormed off to generate a new
plan to steal the girl's cookies.
